Introduction:
Hello , i am Ebuka. I am a passionate Front-End Engineer, and i am hoping to bring this passion to agencyAnalytics!
My goal was to not just do the bare minimum , but go the extra mile to display my skill. So you will find the project
UI is a bit different from the mokup provided.

My design choices:

1: Why Redux:
This is a fairly small application and does not require Redux. But i figured that if the assessment asked to use Class 
components, it would be nice to show i am also familiar with Redux , even though it can be replaced with the newer react hooks.

2: Styled components:
Since react combines all stylesheets during processing, this can cause styles to spill among components. Styled-components helps
since it creates a styled react compoennt , with the styles only applying to that component. It also let's me easily manipulate 
the styles by passing props.

3: Weather icons
The API only give the icon id. So i had to find the icon online. I then mapped the icon ids to react-icons.

4: Handling errors:
It's important to let the user know what happened after an event. I used a toast notification to notify users of errors/success.

5: Theme:
I added light/dark theme so users can use thier preference. I also designed the UI with complimentary colors.

Improvements:
Some Improvements are :
1: Making it responsive.
2: Adding test
3. handling multiple cities with the same name (Eg : london, ON . london, GB)
